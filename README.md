# Adam Watters - Take Home Test

## Notes
* Building scripts.js with grunt-browserify task from ./src directory. Root file is ./src/index.js

## Writeup

### Technnical/Design Decisions

* I created a Model base class that allows for registering and removing callbacks to execute on attribute changes. All model classes extend the Model base class. Views and the router listen for changes on models and render/update accordingly. One complication was including a method for removing callbacks. Buttons for opening wine modals are created and destroyed on each render cycle of the recipes view - I needed a way to remove the callbacks they registered with their respective Product Pairing models. I accomplished this by returning and ID for each registered callback that can be be passed to a the models remove listener method.

* I kept my handlebars templated logicless. I think this is generally a good design decision because it keeps all the logic in one place. With more time I would break down my UI into smaller components to make the DOM building and manipulation easier to reason about - there's a lot happening in the RecipeView's render method.

* I included moment.js to format dates for API calls and for display. Moment.js simplifies the native API for dealing with Dates. I used it to save myself time and to improve readability.

* With more time I would have written tests. This project was a good learning exercise for me - normally given this task I would have reached for a framework. Without a framework, I was exploring and designing as I went along.


## Instructions

Using the HTML, CSS, and mocked API that has been provided for you, your job is to write javascript that drives the view layer of a Blue Apron menu page according to the spec below.

## Setup:

### Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

```
$ npm install
```

### Start [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

```
$ http-server [path]
```

### Point your browser to:

```
localhost:8080
```

### Included:

* [Mockjax](https://github.com/jakerella/jquery-mockjax) API
  * Endpoints can be found at the [bottom of the ReadMe](#api)
  * Endpoints can be used the same way you would for a production API
    * JSON response can be found in `/assets/_defaults/js/mocks` or using your inspector console.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)
* [Bootstrap Modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)
  * Not required. Use it only if it will save you time.
* [HandleBars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
  * Not required. Use it only if it will save you time.

### Notes:

* Use `scripts.js`, `styles.css` or create your own files. Refrain from modifying anything in the `_defaults` folder.
* Example markup and HandleBars templates can be found here:
  * Navigation - `examples/navigation.html`
  * Recipe - `examples/recipe.html` (includes template example)
  * Two person plan layout - `examples/two-person-plan.html`
  * Family plan layout - `examples/family-plan.html`
  * Wine modal - `examples/wine-modal.html` (includes template example)

## Spec:

* Display all the recipes using the default settings.
  * Default week is `2016-03-21`.
  * Default recipe type is `two_person_plan`.
* Use the `JSON` to display the recipe image, title, and subtitle.
  * If the recipe is a vegetarian dish it should display the vegetarian icon.
* Using the tab navigation a user should be able to toggle between viewing "Two Person Plan" recipes and "Family Plan" recipes.
* Using the dropdown a user should be able to view recipes from different weeks.
* If the recipe has a wine pairing a user should be able to click the "View Wine Pairing" button to view a modal showing the *matching* wine pairing information.
  * Use the `JSON` to display the wine image, title (which includes the wine's name, varietals name, and year), and a fun fact.

### Write a short paragraph explaining the following:

* Any technical and/or design decisions you made.
* Any interesting challenges you faced.
  * Be sure to explain how you arrived to your implemented solution and how well you think it solved the problem.
* Anything you may have left out or would have done differently if you had more time.

### Additional Notes:

* Developer should assume additional recipe weeks and wines pairings will be regularly added.
* It's up to the developer to decided how they want to design the application and these features, there is no preferred way.
* Please refrain from using any javascript framework (or library that serves a similar purpose). 
 * examples: Ember, Angular, React, Backbone, etc.
* You are free to use any library, templating engine, etc. *as long as it doesn't implement one of the features in the spec for you*.
  * **If you use any additional third-party code, make sure to explicity explain why you chose to include it, why you felt it was necessary, and why it is the right tool for the job.**

## Extra Credit:

* Add an enhancement that would give a user the ability to bookmark the page, reload the browser, etc. in a manner where the application would resume in that user's current state.
